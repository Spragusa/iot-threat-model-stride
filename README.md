# IoT Threat Modeling – Simulated Critical Infrastructure

This repository contains a structured STRIDE-based threat model for a simulated IoT water management system (Grand Marina scenario).

## 📂 Project Structure

- `/threat-model/grand-marina-threat-model.md`  
  Full professional threat model including:
  - System overview
  - Asset inventory
  - STRIDE analysis
  - Risk prioritization
  - Mitigation recommendations

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate the ability to:
- Apply CIA Triad analysis
- Perform structured STRIDE threat modeling
- Identify high-impact IoT attack paths
- Prioritize risk using Likelihood × Impact matrix
- Recommend practical, layered mitigations

## 🧭 Architecture Overview
